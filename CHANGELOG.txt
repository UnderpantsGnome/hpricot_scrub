2008-06-03 Mina Naguib <mina.hpricotscrub@naguib.ca>
	Release 0.3.1
  - Allow an element rule to be a Proc (which is expected to return one of
	  the other non-proc rules (false/:strip/true/attr_rules).  This allows the
	  building of highly custom filtering rules (for example filter out <B>
	  tags unless their parent is a <P>...)
	- Slight cleanup of internal documentation

	Large overhaul of the module's logic to mimic most of perl's HTML::Scrubber
	functionality:
  	- Deprecate config keys :allow_tags, :remove_tags and :allow_attributes
		- Introduce config keys :elem_rules, :default_elem_rule,
		  :default_comment_rule and :default_attribute_rule
		- Document the above (inline - visible in rdoc & the likes)
